## ⚡ What I Do

- Architect and develop distributed Python services for large-scale data ingestion and analysis  
- Design event-driven microservice systems (RabbitMQ)  
- Build scalable backend services and APIs (Node.js / Express)  
- Develop high-performance analytical and visualization-heavy React applications  
- Drive architectural decisions, enforce engineering standards, mentor developers  

I focus on reliability, scalability, and long-term maintainability — not trends.
